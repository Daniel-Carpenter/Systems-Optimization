# Systems Optimization

## `Exam 1 `

### Setup
* Similar to the exams in canvas - do the practice exams with related questions
* 75 minutes
* By hand (can have calculator)
* Get engineering paper

### Exam 1 Questions
1. Determine constraints, objective function, and gradient
2. Find optimal point using `graph` (linear programming using graph)
    * Plot constraints
    * Plot the gradient (*function growing the fastest*) of the function (and solve for gradient)
    * Discover the solution
3. `Simplex`
    - From initial basic solution 
	- Two-phase
	- Big M
    - Concepts for degeneracy and alternate optima
5. `Python code` for optimization

## Exam 2

### Topics
1. `Duality`
    * X. Constructing dual problems
    * X. Weak and strong duality
    * X. Understanding the meaning of dual variables and their application
2. `Sensitivity Analysis` ***`(rework HW)`*** 
    * Sensitivity analysis (Linear Alg to get to duals) 
    * post-optimal analysis (determine effects of adding new activity/variable) 
    * New constraints, or changing parameters
3. `LP models for Common Structures`
    * X. Data Envelope Analysis ***`(rework HW)`***, 
    * Transportation (go from sets/other to code, vice versa), 
    * Assignment, 
    * Minimum cost flow, and other related problems. 
4. Question or two from `simplex algorithm`, Two-Phase method, and Big M method

Transportation and onward see what is needed in prior exams

## Final Exam

* Pretty much everything that we have covered
* Can use anything - excel or python - must upload extra
* Will have 2 hours + time to upload
